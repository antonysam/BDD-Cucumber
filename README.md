# BDD-Cucumber

# BDD

1) Behaviour Driven Development, is all about collaboration between teams

2) Builds a common understanding on the behaviour of the application

3) Generates common documentation that can be understood by all teams & stakeholders

4) For a new enchancement, feature, change user story is created

# User Story
It is an informal, general explanation of a software feature written from the prespective of the end user

# Steps for the creation of user story
1) It is discussed among teams
2) Conversation and discussion on how the system should behave
3) Examples are created, discussed, agreed and approved
4) Examples are documented in a way that can be developed and tested with automation 
5) Coding phase - implement behaviour as per the documented examples

# Phases in BDD

 1) Discovery -> Explore and discuss on how the system should behave (Agreed behaviour of the system)
 2) Formulation -> Create concrete examples that can be automated (Acceptance Tests)
 3) Automation ->  Coding as per the documented examples to implement the agreed behaviour of the system
                   and Create automation tests taking one example at a time to guide development (Code Implementation and automated tests)

# Cucumber
A tool that facilitates BDD
It is used to automate their documentation

It is a tool that understands your documentation and turns it into automated tests
