BDD-Cucumber
# Discovery
1) A Discovery workshop is a conversation where technical and business people meet
2) Discuss and collaborate to explore, discover and agree as much as they can about the desired behaviour for a User story

# Sample scenario
When a user selects the flight and navigates to the payment process, keep the seats blocked ubtil the process is completed or cancelled

For preparing the above story need to do `3 amigos meeting` (i.e meeting with 3 different disciplines from the teams)

Note: The Discovery process in BDD will start with 3 Amigos Meeting 

Members of the meeting are as follows
1) Product Owner
2) Developer
3) Tester

Output: Agreed Behaviour of the System
